# Gödel Numbering-Based Encryption/Decryption Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a cryptographic model based on Gödel Numbering. The algorithm leverages the Sieve of Eratosthenes for precomputing prime numbers and utilizes the Mersenne Twister (mt19937-64) for random number generation. The model is capable of performing encryption and decryption of strings with lengths up to 1 million characters within 1 second.

## Features

- **Fast Encryption/Decryption**: Can handle strings up to 1 million characters in less than a second.
- **Prime Number Based Encoding**: Utilizes prime numbers and Gödel Numbering for unique character encoding.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: Secure key exchange using Diffie-Hellman for generating encryption keys.
- **Buffer String for Security**: Adds buffer strings to encrypted text for additional security and randomness.

## Installation

To use this project, clone the repository and compile the code using a C++ compiler. The following steps will guide you through the setup:

cd GodelNumberingEncryption


**## Encryption and Decryption Process**

### Example: Encrypting and Decrypting a Message

Suppose we want to encrypt the message "Hello, World!" using the provided encryption algorithm.

#### Step 1: Generate the Encryption Key
First, we use the `diffie_hellman` function to generate a key based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.

```cpp
unsigned long long key = diffie_hellman(7911, 1567689892, 292787734);
